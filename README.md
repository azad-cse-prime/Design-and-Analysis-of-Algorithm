Here about two types of Sorting Algorithm used: 
## Insertion Sort::

(a) A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.

(b) Efficient for small or partially sorted arrays.

---> How it works: Takes one element at a time and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part.

---> Time Complexity:

1) Best: O(n)

2) Average: O(n²)

3) Worst: O(n²)

## Merge Sort::

(a) A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

(b) Efficient for large arrays and arrays in random order.

---> How it works: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them.

--> Time Complexity:

Best / Average / Worst: O(n log n)
